### *1-1 Conversations*
The most basic functionality is to have a normal conversation with another person. To start a new thread, search for the user you are looking for by typing their name into the search bar. If he/she is online - app will give you permission to start a new conversation with him/her.

Additionally, in a 1-1 conversation, both parties have the ability to change their nicknames in that specific thread. So there is no problem to have a different show name in each thread.

In this web application, users can start a group conversation. In the 'Group' section located under the search bar, all available groups are displayed + there is an option to create a new group.
